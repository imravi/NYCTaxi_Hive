## Problem Statement

The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) has provided a dataset of trips made by the taxis in the New York City. The detailed trip-level data is more than just a vast list of taxi pickup and drop off coordinates.  

The purpose of this assignment is to get a better understanding of the taxi system so that the city of New York can improve the efficiency of in-city commutes. Several exploratory questions can be asked about the travelling experience for passengers.

In this assignment, we ONLY consider the data of yellow taxis for November and December of the year 2017.
